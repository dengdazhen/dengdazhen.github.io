## Who are we?

We are the **Interactive Data Group at Zhejiang University (ZJUIDG)**, one of the leading research groups in data visualization globally. Under the supervision of **Prof. Yingcai Wu**, and co-supervised by myself, we conduct cutting-edge research at the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)** and **visual analytics**, through a dedicated division: **ZJUIDG-AIVA (AI for Visual Analytics)**.

Our team has consistently ranked among the top worldwide on [CSRankings.org](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2021/toyear/2025/index?visualization&world) in the visualization field.

## Who are we looking for?

Each year, I recruit **1–2 PhD students** and **3–4 Master’s students**, jointly with Prof. Wu.

If you are passionate about:

- **Trustworthy LLMs**
- **Visual analytics**
- **Data mining**

…and have a strong desire to build technical depth and pursue academic excellence, we warmly welcome your application.

We look for students with one or more of the following skills:

- Experience in **large model training, fine-tuning, and deployment**
- Strong **algorithm development** capabilities
- Proficient **frontend/backend engineering** skills

In addition, a solid foundation in **English and mathematics** is essential. You should be able to read and reproduce top-tier research papers — a fundamental skill for graduate research.

We particularly welcome students with PhD aspirations, as well as Master’s students interested in **transitioning to PhD** or **pursuing international PhDs** after graduation.

- Consider joining the **ZJU Computer Science Summer Camp** if you're applying for a PhD.
- If PhD slots are full, you may apply through the **School of Software's graduate recommendation** in September and later seek to transfer to the PhD track.

## What do we offer?

- A **top-tier research environment**, ample computing resources, and **hands-on mentorship**
- Opportunities to **visit leading international research institutions** for 6–12 month academic exchanges
- Full support to attend **at least one international conference**, even without a paper; additional support for first-author publications
- Access to **competitive industry opportunities**, including **top packages at major companies** like Huawei
