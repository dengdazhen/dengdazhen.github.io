  <h2>How to Apply</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome applications from highly motivated students throughout the year. If you're interested in joining our group, there are multiple paths available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For <strong>PhD applicants</strong>: We encourage you to apply through the
        <a href="http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/csen/2025/0528/c27011a3056015/page.htm" target="_blank">
          ZJU School of Computer Science Summer Camp (计算机学院暑期夏令营)
        </a>, typically held in early summer. During the camp, you will interact with members of ZJUIDG and have the opportunity to showcase your skills and potential. If you perform well but are not admitted due to the limited number of PhD openings, you are encouraged to consider the Master's path described below.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <strong>Master’s applicants</strong>: You may apply through the
        <strong>School of Software Technology’s recommendation round in September (软件学院9月推免)</strong>.
        Outstanding Master's students will have the opportunity to transfer to the PhD track later on.
        Please note that <strong>I am not an industry-focused advisor</strong> (often referred to as “羊导” in Chinese Social Media).
        Master's students typically receive a short internship opportunity only in their second year, usually no longer than three months.
        If you are looking for extensive industry internships starting immediately after enrollment, our team may not be the most suitable fit.
