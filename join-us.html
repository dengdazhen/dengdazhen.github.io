  <h2>How to Apply</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome applications from highly motivated students throughout the year. If you're interested in joining our group, there are multiple paths available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For <strong>PhD applicants</strong>: We encourage you to apply through the
        <a href="http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/csen/2025/0528/c27011a3056015/page.htm" target="_blank">
          ZJUCS Summer Camp (浙江大学计算机学院暑期夏令营)
        </a>, typically held in early summer. During the camp, you will interact with members of ZJUIDG and have the opportunity to showcase your skills and potential. If you perform well but are not admitted due to the limited number of PhD openings, you are encouraged to consider the Master's path described below.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <strong>Master's applicants</strong>: You may apply through the
        <a href="http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/2024/0913/c36207a2962221/page.htm" target="_blank">Graduate Student Recommendation in September (浙江大学软件学院9月研究生推免)</a>.
        Outstanding Master's students will have the opportunity to transfer to the PhD track later on.
        Please note that <strong>I am not an industry-focused advisor</strong>.
        Master's students typically receive an internship opportunity only in their second year, usually no longer than three months.
        If you are looking for extensive industry internships starting immediately after enrollment, our team may not be the most suitable fit.
